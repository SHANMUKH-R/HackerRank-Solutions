2. Python: Vending Machine

Implement class: Vending Machine according to the following requirements:

• can be instantiated using the constructor Vending Machine num_items, item_price) where num items denotes the number of items in the machine, and item_price denotes the
required number of coins to buy a single item. has a method buyreq items, money) that represents a buy request where req_items denotes the requested number of items, and 
money is the amount the customer puts into the machine. Depending on the state of the machine, one of the following happens

o If there are enough items in the machine to serve the request and the given money is sufficient to buy the requested number of items, the number of items in the machine 
is reduced by the requested number of items. The method returns an integer denotes the change given back after the purchase. If there are fewer items in the machine than 
the requested number, it raises a ValueError exception with the message "Not enough items in the machine". If there are enough items in the machine to serve the request
but the given amount of money is less than their cost. It raises a ValueError exception with the message "Not enough coins".

The class implementation will be tested by a provided code stub and several input files. Each input file contains parameters to test the implementation. First, the provided 
code stub initializes an instance of the Vending Machine. Next, it performs the given operations on the Vending Machine instance. The result of their execution will be 
printed to the standard output by the provided code.

Constraints

• There will be at most 100 operations to be performed

✓ Input Format Format for Custom Testing

Input from stdin will be processed as follows and passed to the function.

In the first line, there are two space-separated integers num_items and item_price denoting the parameters to initialize the Vending Machine. In the second line, there is 
an integer n denoting the number of operations to be performed on a Vending Machine instance.

Each of the following n lines contains two space separated integers, num_items and money, that denote a single operation to be performed on the Vending Machine, along with 
its parameters if any.

The code initializes the Vending Machine: machine = Vending Machine(10, 2), i.e. a machine with 10 items, each costing 2 coins. Then, there are 4 operations to be performed:

1. The method buy(1, 5) is called, i.e. a request of buying 1 item with 5 units of currency is performed. There are enough items in the machine to serve the request and the 
given money is sufficient to purchase them. The change, 5-1*2= 3 in this case, is returned by the method, and the number of items in the machine is reduced by 1. 
There are 9 items in the machine after the request.

2. The method buy(10, 100) is called, l.e. a request of buying 10 items with 100 units of currency is performed. There are not enough items in the machine to serve the request,
so a ValueError is raised with the message "Not enough items in the machine".

3. The method buy(7, 100) is called, i.e. a request of buying 10 items with 100 units of currency is performed. There are enough items in the machine to serve the request and 
the given money is sufficient to purchase them. The change, 100-7*2=86, is returned and the number of items in the machine is reduced by 7. Now there are 9-7-2 items in the 
machine.

4. The method buy(2, 3) is called, i.e. a request of buying 2 items with 3 units of currency is performed. There are enough items in the machine but the money is not enough. 
A ValueError is raised with the message "Not enough coins".

Explanation 1

The code initializes the Vending Machine: machine = Vending Machine(100, 1), i.e. a machine with 100 items, each costing 1 unit. There are 2 operations to be performed:
• The method buy(50, 50) is called, i.e. a request of buying 50 items with 50 units of currency is performed. There are enough items in the machine and the given money 
is sufficient to purchase them. Change = 50-50*1 = 0 in this case, which is returned by the method. The item count is reduced by 50 leaving 50 items in the machine.

. The method buy(50, 60) is called, i.e. a request of buying 50 items with 60 units of currency is performed. There are enough items in the machine to serve the request 
and the given money is sufficient, so the change, 60 50*1 = 10, is returned and the number of items is reduced by 50. Now there are 0 items in the machine.
